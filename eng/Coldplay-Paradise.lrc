[00:02.73]Paradise
[00:03.84]Coldplay
[00:06.00]
[00:54.41]Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
[00:57.86]Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
[01:00.81]
[01:01.29]When she was just a girl
[01:05.22]She expected the world
[01:08.21]But it flew away from her reach
[01:11.66]So she ran away in her sleep
[01:15.09]And dreamed of para-para-paradise
[01:18.97]Para-para-paradise
[01:22.40]Para-para-paradise
[01:25.90]Every time she closed her eyes
[01:28.93]
[01:36.17]Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
[01:39.57]Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo
[01:43.27]When she was just a girl
[01:46.43]She expected the world
[01:49.46]But it flew away from her reach
[01:52.89]And the bullets catch in her teeth
[01:56.66]Life goes on, it gets so heavy
[02:00.03]The wheel breaks the butterfly
[02:03.64]Every tear a waterfall
[02:06.59]In the night, the stormy night
[02:09.49]She closed her eyes
[02:13.43]In the night, the stormy night
[02:16.33]Away she flies
[02:20.39]Dream of para-para-paradise
[02:24.28]Para-para-paradise
[02:27.76]Para-para-paradise
[02:31.20]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[02:34.60]She dreamt of para-para-paradise
[02:38.00]Para-para-paradise
[02:41.41]Para-para-paradise
[02:44.87]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[02:47.99]
[03:01.62]Lalalalala lalalalala lalalalala lala
[03:08.41]So lying underneath the stormy skies
[03:15.30]She'd say oh oh oh oh oh
[03:18.21]I know the sun's set to rise
[03:22.21]This could be para-para-paradise
[03:26.05]Para-para-paradise
[03:29.05]Could be para-para-paradise
[03:32.92]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[03:36.05]This could be para-para-paradise
[03:39.73]Para-para-paradise
[03:42.75]Could be para-para-paradise
[03:46.62]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[03:49.83]
[03:54.88]Oh oh
[03:56.10]
[04:03.41]This could be para-para-paradise
[04:07.31]Para-para-paradise
[04:10.22]Could be para-para-paradise
[04:14.06]Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
[04:17.56]Oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo...
