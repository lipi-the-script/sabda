[00:22.50]and I can't back down
[00:24.55]I've been losing so much time
[00:32.14]cause it's you and me and all of the people
[00:37.69]with nothing to do
[00:40.79]nothing to lose
[00:42.66]and it's you and me and all of the people

[01:36.90]and I don't know why
[01:39.72]I can't keep my eyes off of you

[01:50.45]I can't quite figure out
[01:55.27]everything she does is beautiful
[02:00.36]everything she does is right
[02:07.41]cause it's you and me and all of the people
[02:12.99]with nothing to do
[02:15.88]nothing to lose
[02:17.83]and it's you and me and all of the people
